# Image-Style-Transfer-with-Real-Time-Feedback
This project aims to develop an application that leverages machine learning to transfer artistic styles onto real-time webcam feed or uploaded images using computer graphics techniques. The ML model will be responsible for understanding the artistic style, and the computer graphics part will apply this style to the input images.
